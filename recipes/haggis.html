        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <li>
                <ul>Rinse pluck in cold water, trim off any large piece of fat and cut away the windpipe.</ul>
                <ul>Place in a good sized pot and cover with cold water.  Bring to boil and skim the surface regulary, simmer for 2 hours.</ul>
                <ul>Lift the meat from theh pot and rinse in cold water to remove scum, leave in a bowl to cool.</ul>
                <ul>Strain cooking liquid through a fine sieve and put back on the stove to reduce until you between .5 and 1 l of stock.  Leave to cool</ul>
                <ul>While stock reduces, finely dice the cooked heart and lungs.  Grate the liver using the coarse side of the grater, finley dice the trimmings.  Mix together in a large bowl, along with the suet, oatmeal ans spices.</ul>
                <ul>Measure how much stock remains from cooking the pluck and make up to 1l with cold water.  When cool, add to haggis mixture.</ul>
                <ul>To check the seasoning, pan fry a tablespoon of the mixture for 2-3 minutes and taste.  Add any extra salt, pepper or spice if needed.</ul>
                <ul>Spoon the haggis mixture into the soaked, rinsed ox bung.  Be aware the filling swells as it cooks, so pack quite loosely and keep a little bung at each end.</ul>
                <ul>When the haggis is the size required, expel any extra air, pinch, tie with string and cut with scissors.</ul>
                <ul>Tie the new end of the bung and continue stuffing.  Freeze any spare haggises.</ul>
                <ul>Before cooking, pierce the haggis several times with a needle.  Place in a pan of cold water and bring to a boil.  Simmer for 1.5-2 hours.  When ready the internal temperature should read at least 74C or 165F</ul>
                <ul>Serve with mashed potatoes and swede.  Or neeps and tatties</ul>
